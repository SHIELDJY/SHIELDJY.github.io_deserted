<h2 id="something-to-say">Something to say</h2>

<p>Recently I participate a contest named Integrate Circuit Innovation Contest which requires me to use WJ100 developed by Ali Inc. team t-head and a FPGA develop board with Xlinx XC7A200TR3B Core. Itâ€™s not my first time to cope with FPGA but still, I find it difficult to interpret Verilog Code and make the FPGA works. Luckily, with the help of WJ100 Sdk and CDK(C-sky Develop Kit) which developed by Ali Inc. we could jump the Verilog and long waiting synthesizing part directly to use the pre-setted circuit and easy writing C to develop.</p>

<h2 id="about-wj100">About WJ100</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>T-Headâ€™s Wujian SoC Platform utilizes the cloud-terminal-integration design philosophy that fuses software and hardware. Full stack integration of chips, operating systems and algorithms enables customers to develop chip products that can be mass-production.</p>

  <p>Low power consumption: User-defined power consumption scenarios, with standby power consumption of less than 1uA, and operating power consumption of less than 100uA/MHz</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the official sites of t-head Inc., WJ100 is a low cost and high power efficiency SoC, which barely means that it could be easily deployed on any chips and consumes lower power.</p>

<p>However, as I talked before, it is a open source project and as I believed, the real function of this SoC is to simplify the use of FPGA and to offer the developer a brand new way to develop: integrate Soc and FPGA to deal with some projects which require both power efficiency and fast steady frequency.</p>

<h3 id="part-7-timer">Part 7 TIMER</h3>

<h4 id="1-what-is-timer">1 What is Timer</h4>

<p>Timer is a count up counter in SoC. There are normally several opration modes for timer, for example, auto-reload mode, counter mode, manual reload mode, etc. Interrupt is normally used when using auto-reload mode timer for controlling dc motor or any device requires periodical responds.</p>

<p>In wujian100 SoC, there are 16 channels/timers which I am not sure about since the official does not offer any docs. However, there are two modes, i.e. reload mode and freerunning mode which again i am not sure what freerunning could be used for.</p>

<h4 id="2-let-us-see-what-we-have-got-in-library">2 Let us see what we have got in library</h4>

<p>Timer is quite a simple module to use in wujian100 and hence it does not offer us many advanced options. Here is library for timer which could be found in <code class="highlighter-rouge">.\csi_driver\include\drv_timer.h</code>.</p>

<h4 id="3-how-to-use-these-functions">3 How to use these functions</h4>

<p>Now we have reached to the high points of this article, the use of Timer in wujian100 SoC.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Initialize timer handler. timer_num is the timer you would like to use, i.e. <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> for timer0, <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code> for timer1, etc. And just like what we did in UART part, we had better write a callback function to deal with timer interrupt event call back.</p>

    <pre><code class="language-C++"> timer_handle = csi_timer_initialize(timer_num, timer_event_cb_fun);
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>configure timer as anyway you would like it to be.</p>

    <pre><code class="language-C++"> csi_timer_config(timer_handle, TIMER_MODE_RELOAD);
</code></pre>

    <p>or for freerunning mode</p>

    <pre><code class="language-C++"> csi_timer_config(timer_handle, TIMER_MODE_FREE_RUNNING);
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>set timeout <code class="highlighter-rouge">only in reload mode</code>, timeout is in microseconds, i.e. us</p>

    <pre><code class="language-C++"> csi_timer_set_timeout(timer_handle, timeout_us);
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>start timer and say BINGO <strong>(must*)</strong> !</p>

    <pre><code class="language-C++"> csi_timer_start(timer_handle);
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember to put something in callback function. Otherwise you would see nothing is happening. And more intriging thing in CDK is that stop points does not work in call back function which make it difficult to debug interrupt which I will write about in next article.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Note* It does not really matter if you say bingo or not.</li>
</ul>
