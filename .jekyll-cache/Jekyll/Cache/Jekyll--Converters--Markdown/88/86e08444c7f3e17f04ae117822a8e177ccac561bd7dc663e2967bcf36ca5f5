<p>Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) is a type of random access semiconductor memory that stores each bit of data in a memory cell consisting of a tiny capacitor and a transistor, both typically based on metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) technology.<em>wikipedia</em></p>

*Figure 2.1 DRAM Cell Structure</p>

<p>From figure 2.1, as we could see, DRAM is actually a 1T1C(one transistor and one capacitor) structure. Writing process is accomplished by selecting bit line 1 and word line 2 thus pull up/down the voltage of capacitor 4. Firstly, data is stored by applying high voltage to both word line 2 and bit line 1. And then data is stored by applying a low voltage to the word line 2 and trapping the charge on the storage capacitor. Subsequently, the data is accessed by applying a high voltage to the wordline to make FET work in depletion mode, conduction bitline and capacitor, so that the voltage on the bit line 1 could be sensed. Then Word line or Bit line is turned to be Low Voltage Level to config next cell so that FET works in cut off mode and thus the voltage level is stored in capacitor 4. When the data is read, apply a high voltage on word line 2 and thus the charges in capacitor 4 is released and could be sensed in bit line 2.</p>

<p>However, this memory cell structure is volatile for two reason. For one, the voltage level of capacitor is hold due to its capacity of charges, but the charges will leak as time passed by. This process is basically due to the current leakage. And there is an important term names retention time. The retention time can be defined as the duration until the stored signal can be read out. There are several leakage current mechanisms, by which the stored signal disappears [11]. Including 1) junction leakage current from the storage node, 2) subthreshold leakage current of the transfer transistor, 3) capacitor dielectric leakage current, 4) gate induced drain leakage (GIDL) current at the storage node,5) gate dielectric leakage current, and 6) isolation leakage current between the neighboring cells. Study shows, the major leakage paths in a DRAM cell are reverse junction leakage from the storage node and gate induced drain leakage (GIDL) current [1]. For two, the reading process, the process we have discussed before, is destructive to the charge stored in the capacitor, which stands for the data. And this is due to its 1T1C stucture.</p>

<p>Hence, Dynamic Random Access memory, although cheap to manufature (in contrast to early stage solid states hard drive), fast read - write process and almost unlimited read-write cycles, has a fatal problem. It‚Äôs volatile feature. But nowadays there are problems with solid state memories and also with traditional DRAM. So there are quite a few researches that deal with the novel structure of DRAM and novel FET(Feild Effct Transistors).</p>

<h2 id="3-latest-researches-on-dram">3. Latest researches on DRAM</h2>

<p>Although the principle of 1T1C DRAM is relatively simple, the capacitor in it is not that simple, for it requires a relatively large capacity of charge in its scale (around 30 fF/cell). Anyone who has some knowledge about capacitor should aware that Farad is not a small unit, 10mF capacitor could be called as ‚ÄúSuper Capacitor‚Äù and is huge for a normal sized PCB.

<p>It is not difficult to imagine how large it is for a 30fF Cap in a DRAM cell. To deal with this issue, some reseachers[2]-[10] create a 1T structure, or floating-body cell (FBC) for DRAM. The FBC structure is shown in <em>Figure 3.2</em>. It operates as follows: When excess holes exist in the floating-body and Vth lowers, the cell state can be regarded as ‚Äú1.‚Äù On the other hand, when excess holes are swept out of the floating-body by a forward bias on the body‚Äìdrain junction and Vth becomes higher, the cell state can be regarded as ‚Äú0.‚Äù The drain-current difference between ‚Äú1‚Äù and ‚Äú0‚Äù states can be sensed in the linear current region so as not to change the number of holes by the II current[2], which is an impact-ionization current used in wrting process.

<p>However, this novel method is not widely taken for it has fatal weakness: its writing process is heavily relied on II current and 1 and 0 states detected by current. This is not what we truely like in an operating device. Since millions of cells could produce a huge current so that the impedence of the whole device must be extradinary low which is unacheivable. Moreover, most threads of devices are refused to drain current for it is designed with a high pull up resistor to increase its impedance so as to increase its capability of voltage detection. The 1T DRAM could not be compatible with most common device.</p>
